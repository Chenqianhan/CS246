2(a) Confidence is defined as the probability of occurrence of B in the basket if the basket already contains A. Assume the occurrence of B is small and the occurrence of A is large, but A always occurs when B occurs. In this case, we should claim that the confidence is high. However, the large value of A makes it seem not high enough. This is the drawback of confidence. Since the other two measurement takes Pr(B) into consideration, they do not have this drawback.
